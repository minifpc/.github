## Welcome to miniFPC 👋
The goal is to make the smallest possible executables that can be created with the Free Pascal Compiler (FPC).<br>
Currently under Windows only, because as the project relies heavily on the WinAPI.

If you have a question, you can drop a message by create a discussion thread.<br>
We would do our best to react fast as possible.

The project is splited into several sub-repros because different members in different teams are busy at current time.<br>
This is not the final state of all, and changes can be occur quickly.<br>

Check out the project directory - there a some working examples.

Have a nice day - your miniFPC Team<br>
